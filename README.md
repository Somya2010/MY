### About Me

<!-- About-Me:START -->
🎓 I'm an ambitious engineering undergraduate majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Rajasthan Technical University, Kota.

💡 Throughout my academic journey, I've built numerous mid-level projects. I am also well-versed in data structures and algorithms using C++, enabling me to solve complex problems efficiently.

👩🏻‍💻 I actively contribute to the open-source community and serve as a mentor at GSSoC (GirlScript Summer of Code), guiding and supporting aspiring developers in their open-source projects.

🏆 I'm proud to have participated in the prestigious 'Samsung Solve For Tomorrow Challenge,' where my team was selected among the top 50 teams from across India. This experience sharpened my collaborative skills and exposed me to real-world challenges.

🌟 In addition to my technical pursuits, I am also Google Crowdsource Influencer. 

💻 I'm deeply passionate about coding and thrive on new experiences, meeting new people, and learning new things. I take pleasure in sharing my expertise with the community and actively collaborating with teams to drive meaningful impact.
